                    <h3>Scheduling A time</h3>
                    <p>There are 2 ways to schedule a time. One of them is to book an appointment using the link below.
                        The other is to simply walk in. Walk ins are welcome however, this does not gaurentee you immediate services. Those who have
                        and appointment booked will take seniority.
                    </p>

                    <p>Make sure you show up for your meetings on time. I have a 15 minuite grace period before you will loose senority to 
                        walk in customers and those who booked up for any times after you. If you are past your appointment time and I am unable to 
                        find another time that day, you will have to reschedule.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>If you know you cannot make it, please remove your reservation at the earliest convience.</p>

                    <h3>The First Fitting</h3>
                    <p>For "Quick Fixes"</p>
                    <p> This will be your only fitting. If the garmet has a hole or other injury, measurements nor a filling will likely be
                        required. If it is a sizing issue measurements will be taken. This includes the measuremnts of the body that the garment 
                        does not conform to but may also require other measurements depending on the type of alteration. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Please note: that if you have a walk-in appointment I cannot gaurentee same visit returns.</p>
                    <p>For "Alterations"</p>
                    <p>Your first fitting will consist of 2 parts. To begin, you will be asked to put the garmet on (if possible) and 
                        we will talk about what alterations can be done. If the garment is unable to be worn this will be done on a maniquin. 
                        This will include pinning the garmet into the desired shape so you can see it and I can take notes. 
                        The second part is taking all relevant measurement to alter the garment. The garment will be left with me and a second fitting
                        will be scheduled.                    
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li style="--i: 4">
                    <h3>Second Fitting</h3>
                    <p>The goal of this fitting is to confirm the comfort of the alteration. You will try the garment on (if possible) and 
                        we will assess the final fit. If needed, a second round of alterations can be done, in which case this fitting will
                        run the same as the first. However -and more likley-  you will be able to take (or even wear) the garment home.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Payment</h3>
                    <p>A $5.00 is required to book an appointment and is not refundable if the appointment is canceled less than 6 hours before 
                        the scheduled time. The $5.00 is treated as a downpayment and will be put towawrds the final cost of the garment. There will be 
                        payment options in-store before you leave including: cash.
