            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Hannah Edwards. I am a self-taught tailor and designer living in Cincinnati, OH. I started pinning fabric scraps on 
                my barbies. I had a special stand and bucket of different quilting scraps from my grandmother. I'm 25 now and I have been making 
                and altering my own wardrobe for over 8 years. It's a service I want to offer to my community. <br><br>

                How you want clothing to fit and flatter is a choice that has been taken away. I firmly believe that clothing is a fundamental commonent to identity and dignity. Both of those things are being sacrificed in the 
                name of consumerism and fast-fashion. Your clothing should not simply exist to fit something sorta shaped like a human, your clothing
                should fit you and your body.  <br><br>

                Most people don't have any reference of understanding of how clothing used to work. Blazers and sport coats were made to last your
                entire life, with construction that allowed you to gain and lose weight. Skirts would be taken up and in to fit your exact waist or hips. 
                Shirts would last decades becuase they were supposed to last decades. That's why your dad still has shirts from 1975. 
                They might not be in fashion any more but they're still perfectly functional to embarrass you at graduation.<br><br>

                Owning high quality clothing that is made to fit you is a life changing experience. You are wrapped in something made with thought, passion
                and you in mind. It fits so you and only you are comfortable and it's going to be with you for a long time. It makes you pull your
                shoulder back and lift your chin a little higher. Clothing defines our movements. I want you to be able to define your clothing.<br>
